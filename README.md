然后利用google搜索得到完整密文及密钥

Question 2
按照流程进行编程，利用给出代码可以解密得到

密钥和密文为

º²SÍ>
Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for, among other things, secure communication in the presence of attackers. Cryptography has been used for hundreds, if not thousands, of years, but traditional cryptosystems were designed and evaluated in a fairly ad hoc manner. For example, the Vigenere encryption scheme was thought to be secure for decades after it was invented, but we now know, and this exercise demonstrates, that it can be broken very easily.


Question 3

将文本使用base64解密后，按照keysize为2-40判断，选取keysize长度的4段密文计算其汉明距离，发现当kesize为29是，汉明距离/keysize值最小，取keysize为29。解密时，爆破每一位用其与秘文相对应为解密，取解密结果字母最多的key作为最终key，分别爆破即可求得结果，并进行解密
